## Development

This app is built with the NativeScript CLI. Once you have the [CLI installed](https://docs.nativescript.org/start/quick-setup), start by cloning the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/williamjuan027/nativescript-movies-demo.git

cd nativescript-movies-demo
```

From there you can run the app on iOS and Android using the following commands:

```bash
npm run start.ios

npm run start.android
```

> This app uses the new RootLayout component from Nativescript 8 which is still curently in alpha, make sure that the latest Nativescript alpha is installed prior to running the app

```bash
npm install -g nativescript@alpha
```
